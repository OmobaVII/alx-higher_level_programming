How to use 4-print_square.py
============================

This library is very simple, as it has only one function
``print_square()``.

``print_square`` prints a square with the "#" and the size of the square
is the only argument the function takes.

::
    >>> print_square = __import__('4-print_square').print_square
    >>> print_square(3)
    ###
    ###
    ###

    >>> print_square(4)
    ####
    ####
    ####
    ####

    >>> print_square(0)

cases caught by code
::
    >>> print_square("boy")
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    TypeError: size must be an integer

    >>> print_square(-2)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    ValueError: size must be >= 0

    >>> print_square(-0.46)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    TypeError: size must be an integer

cases not caught by code

    >>> print_square()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
